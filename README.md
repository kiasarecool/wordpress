Hopefully some of this will help you! Lots of custom changes I made to woocommerce to make my website kcplantfactory.com work for B2B wholesale yet still allow guests to see every page on the site without worry of them placing orders or seeing prices. Google loves that and it has helped tremendously with the SEO.

I always do what I can to avoid using a plugin whenever possible since they are 90% bloatware, 100% definately slow the whole site down and more often than not end up causing some kind of conflict and drive you (or your web dev) insane trying to fix.

Custom fees for any payment plugin should be included with woocommerce by default if you ask me; it is not... but it is easy enough to implement, so here it is :)

Check out the CSS section for help centering things and making those long product names fit etc.
